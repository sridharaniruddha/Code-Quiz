# Code-Quiz

## User Story
I want to create a web application that allows users to test their coding knowledge by taking a timed quiz that provides their scores instantly.

## Acceptance Criteria 

I will have completed my brief once the following conditions are met
* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When an answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display the score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
